# Telepresence-Robot
Be able to control a telepresence robot from your browser! 

This project utilizes a Flask (Flask-SocketIO), Python, HTML/CSS, JS, a to render a webpage that you can control a telepresence robot. 

It currently only streams the video onto the webpage. Functionality for controlling the robot will be added soon

The webpage utilizes the Flask video streaming from Miguel Grinberg here: https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/flask-video-streaming.
