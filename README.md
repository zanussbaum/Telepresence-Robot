# Telepresence-Robot
Be able to control a telepresence robot from your browser! 

This project utilizes a Flask, Python, React, and HTML/CSS to render a webpage that you can control a telepresence robot. 

It currently only streams the video onto the webpage. 

The webpage utilizes the Flask video version from Miguel Grinberg here: https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/flask-video-streaming.
